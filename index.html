			<h1>My friends call me Giff.</h1>
			<h2>These days, I live in San Francisco and work in fintech.  How did I get here?</h2>

					<li>Growing up in Baltimore, I became a fiercely loyal Orioles and Ravens fan.  I attended Gilman School through graduation, where I played soccer and geeked out on the quiz bowl team.  Although I've since lived in Philadelphia, London, DC, San Francisco, and soon Chicago, I always consider Baltimore home.</li>

					<li>My aptitude for economics and problem-solving led me to Cornerstone Research.  During my four years there, I led teams of analysts performing complex economic and financial analysis for high-profile litigation cases.</li>

					<li>I moved to suburban Philadelphia to attend Haverford College, a tight-knit community of thinkers and doers.  There, I studied Mathematical Economics, tutored other Economics students, and continued playing soccer.  I even had the opportunity to spend my junior year studying abroad at the LSE.</li>

					<li>I joined SoFi earlier this year in order to apply my financial and analytical skills in an operational role.  I now conduct research on the company's loan performance and provide policy recommendations to the CEO, CFO, and Chief Risk Officer.</li>
