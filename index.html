					<li><a href="http://www.gilman.edu/" target="_blank"><img src="images/gilman.jpg"></a></li>
					<li>I grew up in Baltimore and attended Gilman School through graduation. In high school, I played soccer and geeked out on the quiz bowl team.  I've since lived in Philadelphia, London, DC, San Francisco, and soon Chicago, but I always consider Baltimore home.</li>
					<li><br></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.cornerstone.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/cornerstone.png"></a></li>
					<li>After Haverford, I joined to Cornerstone Research, an economic consulting firm.  During my four years there, I led teams performing complex analyses for fascinating, high-stakes litigation cases.  My projects involved banks, private equity firms, foodservice distributors, animation companies, and electronics manufacturers.</li>

					<li><a href="http://www.haverford.edu/" target="_blank"><img src="images/haverford.png"></a></li>					
					<li>I moved to suburban Philadelphia to attend Haverford College, a tight-knit community of thinkers and doers.  There, I studied Mathematical Economics, tutored other students, and continued playing soccer.  For my junior year, I studied abroad at the LSE.</li>
					<li><br></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.sofi.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/sofi2.png"></a></li>
					<li>I joined SoFi in early 2016, applying my financial and analytical skills to their credit team.  I now conduct research on the company's loan performance and provide credit policy recommendations to the CEO, CFO, and Chief Risk Officer.  I am inspired by the positive impact that SoFi has on its 200,000+ members' lives.</li>

			<h1>Here's what matters to me.</h1>
		
			<div class="bullet"></div>
			<p><span style="color:#324776; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em;">The Outdoors.  </span><span style="color: #7c7c7c;">I fell in love with the outdoors when I moved to San Francisco several years ago.  Northern California, and the entire American West, has remarkable natural resources.  In the past few years, I have hiked Half Dome in Yosemite; watched the sunrise at the Grand Canyon; explored waterfalls in the Columbia River Gorge; wandered through otherwordly crevasses in Antelope Canyon; solo-hiked Hawaii's treacherous Kalalau Trail; and camped in numerous nearby state parks.  I love the solitude and serenity that nature offers&mdash;a rejuvenating counterweight to the chaos of city life.</span></p>
		
			<div class="bullet"></div>
			<p><span style="color:#324776; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">Finance for Good.  </span><span style="color: #7c7c7c;">The public image of finance is justifiably tarnished.  I still believe that financial institutions can be engines for economic growth and widespread prosperity, by channelling capital from where it is plentiful to where it is scarce.  But the system only works if consumers are treated fairly in the process.  At SoFi, I am proud to help grow a modern finance company that is invested in its members' success.</span></p>

			<div class="bullet"></div>
			<p><span style="color:#324776; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">Crosswords.  </span><span style="color: #7c7c7c;">I started doing crosswords as a kid, when my parents would let me try out the Sunday New York Times puzzle.  I have been hooked ever since.  In addition to solving them, I occasionally create my own themed puzzles as well.  A highlight of my college career occurred when I had dinner with Will Shortz, editor of the New York Times Crossword, as part of a speaker series.</span></p>

			<div class="bullet"></div>
			<p><span style="color:#324776; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">Analytics and Data.  </span><span style="color: #7c7c7c;">I am passionate about exploring data for work and for fun.  In college, I focused on data-intensive courses like Statistics, Econometrics, Policy Impact Evaluation, and my year-long senior thesis project.  Professionally, I have sought out roles at Cornerstone and SoFi that allow me to draw meaningful insights from vast datasets.<!--  Looking ahead to business school, I plan to pursue a pathway in Data Analytics at Kellogg to build on this interest.--></span></p>

			<div class="bullet"></div>
			<p><span style="color:#324776; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">Personal Health.  </span><span style="color: #7c7c7c;">I deeply value my health and wellness.  I keep a rigorous exercise schedule, interspersing weightlifting with cardio activities like biking and running.  In addition, I adhere to mostly vegetarian diet, eating meat only on special occassions.  Keeping a healthy body and mind matters immensely to me.</span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#324776; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">Road Tripping.  </span><span style="color: #7c7c7c;">There is no better way of seeing the USA than by car.  In my life, I have embarked on numerous 1,000+ mile road trips.  These trips have given me a view into parts of the country I otherwise might never have visited.  They have also brought me closer with my fellow travelers, both family and friends.  On these excursion, the joy existed in both the journey and the destination.</span></p>

			<h1>Here's what I'm good at.</h1>
			
			<h2>Using software to understand data</h2>
			<p>I have extensive experience using a variety of software packages to analyze all types and sizes of data.  I have been drawn to opportunities to do so at work, in school, and for my own personal projects.  Examples of my work include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Stata</b>: Performed statistical tests for my college senior thesis and for antitrust-related projects at Cornerstone Research.</li>
					<li><b>SAS</b>: Cleaned, organized, analyzed, and summarized transaction-level sales and costs data for multiple projects at Cornerstone Research.</li>
					<li><b>SQL</b>: Manipulated and structured large (1TB+) datasets for multiple cases at Cornerstone.  Used SQL both via an Aginity workbench as well as the proc SQL feature in SAS.</li>
					<li><b>R</b>: Organized and analyzed loan-level data from SoFi and Lending Club, and identified credit attributes that predict loan performance.</li>
					<li><b>Tableau</b>: Created dashboards of loan performance and origination data to improve real-time reporting at SoFi.</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Leading and motivating teams</h2>
			<p>I am a skilled and experienced leader across multiple contexts.  In high school and college, I captained quiz bowl teams, soccer teams, and speaker committees.  In addition to leading groups of analysts on my projects at Cornerstone, I have also headed up the analyst learning program, community service program, and analyst recruiting program.  I enjoy the responsibility and human interaction that accompanies leading my peers in and outside of work.</p>

			<h2>Mentoring talented people</h2>
			<p>At Cornerstone, I actively mentored younger analysts by explaining best practices, guiding them through difficult projects, and demonstrating the firm's supportive culture.  Via the Minds Matter program, I also guided a high school student through her college application process, culminating with 6 acceptances, public financial aid, and $30,000 in private scholarships.  Before that, I gained mentoring experience through my role as Economics tutor in college.</p>

			<h2>Interviewing and assessing individuals' potential</h2>
			<p>I have conducted 200+ interviews for applicants to Haverford College, SoFi's credit team, Cornerstone's full-time analyst program and summer internship, and the Minds Matter mentee program.  Through these interactions, I have become skilled at forging immediate connections with my interviewees and quickly understanding their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
